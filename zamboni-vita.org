#+begin_comment --- How to include private information in the CV ---
The "Private info" section contains private information which should not be included in the CV by default. It is kept encrypted automatically thanks to the org-crypt package, whose configuration you can see here: https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.org#encryption. The "crypt" tag causes it to be encrypted automatically every time the file is saved, and the "noexport" tag causes it to be omitted when the file gets exported. Its contents, when unencrypted, contains field definitions like this:

,#+mobile: <my mobile number>
,#+address: <my address>
,#+extrainfo: <other private information>

When encrypted, this information is simply ignored. When I want to produce a version of my CV which includes this information, I run ~M-x org-decrypt-entry~, which prompts for my GPG passphrase. Then, *without saving the file*, I run the following export command:

(org-export-to-file 'awesomecv "zamboni-vita-private.tex")

- An active worm-detection system, in wide deployment in the IBM worldwide internal network. Billy Goat listens for connections to unused IP address ranges and actively responds to those connections to accurately detect worm-infected machines, and in many cases capture the worms themselves. Billy Goat is engineered for distributed deployment, with each device containing standalone detection and reporting capabilities, together with data centralization features that allow network-wide data analysis and reporting.

- An active worm-capture device deployed at the network boundary and coupled with the border router, that allows the Billy Goat to effectively and automatically spoof every unused IP address outside the local network. This makes it possible for the Router-based Billy Goat to accurately detect local infected machines and prevent them from establishing connections to the outside, limiting the propagation of the worms to the outside network.
